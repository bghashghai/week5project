    <p> Dance can mean many different things for different people. Oxford Languages defines dance as moving rhythmically to music, typically following a set of steps. Dance is an interpretative art form, therefore can be done by anyone and in any way they see fitting. Dance can look completely different and varies from culture to culture. There are many popular styles people are more aware of, such as classical ballet, jazz, tap, hip hop, lyrical, contemporary. But there are so many underappreciated styles such as swing, Capoeira, Bollywood, salsa, Calypso and many more. These non western dance styles and many more, often get overlooked in the dance community even though they have helped shape the moves and styles known today. </p>

    <p> Bailey - June 2005
    <p> I began dancing at the age of 2 at a dance studio down the street from my house. I never would have imagined continuing with it until the day I graduated. Nevertheless, I danced at <a href="https://www.danceacademyusa.com/" target="_blank">Dance Academy USA</a> for 16 years. This experience helped me grow as a person and introduced me to lifelong skills. I was able to learn more about myself through dance, meet my absolute best friends in the entire world, and gain practical skills I have taken with me to college. While I appreciate everything I learned from it, it really was all about the dancing and how much I loved it. Pursuing something I was passionate about, that also pushed my body and made me stronger, physically, emotionally, and mentally was so rewarding. Dance is something I miss and think about picking up again often. In the meantime, my Dance in Cultural Perception and Expression class will have to do.
